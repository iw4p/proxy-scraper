* With `-v` or `--verbose`, more details.
* With `-h` or `--help`, Show help to who did't read this README.

For checking:

```bash

```

* With `-t` or `--timeout`, dismiss the proxy after -t seconds (Default is **20**)
* With `-p` or `--proxy`, check HTTPS or HTTP proxies (Default is **HTTP**)

## Good to know
* Dead proxies will be removed and just alive proxies will stay.
* This script is also able to scrape Socks, but proxyChecker only checks HTTP(S) proxies.
